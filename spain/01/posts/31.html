        <h3>End of January!</h3>
        Hello to anyone reading this. My first (almost) month is finishing in Madrid. Nothing too exciting has happened since my last post. I almost have a phone again, it's currently working its way through customs. Hopefully I'll get it tomorrow to start out the new month. No exciting trips since last week, although I have toured the city a bit more. Coming up, however, we've got a few things. On the 11th of February I'll be heading to Segovia on a day trip, ~9am-9pm. Should be awesome, I've heard a lot of great things about the city. After that, we may be going to Lucerne, Switzerland from Feb 23-27, which is our winter break. Haven't officially decided on that yet, but it's looking promising. After that, we currently only have a trip to Amsterdam planned from March 3-6. The weekend after that, (March 10th) the rest of the family is coming out to Europe to spend Sam's spring break here. Lots of stuff to look forward to, and still a lot to plan! Definitely looking forward to it.

        Still no phone to take pics, but there are some <a href="../gallery/index.html">here.</a> Check back for February's pics when I've got my phone. Lots of pretty sights to be captured!
