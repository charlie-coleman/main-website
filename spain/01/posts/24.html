        <h3>Blog!</h3>
        <p>Hey, I've finally gotten around to starting this blog thing. I'm going to attempt to post something at least once a week, but we'll see how that goes. So here's summary of my abroad trip so far, it'll probably be decently long. I arrived on Jan. 8th, was going to get off the plane when I noticed my phone was missing. I searched for it, some of the flight attendants searched for it, and the cleaning crew searched for it later. No one found it. So, started off on the wrong foot. Next, my roommate Alex and I took a taxi to our host family's apartment.</p>
        <h4>Host Family</h4>
        <p>Our host family doesn't speak any English, but I know a little bit, enough to get by. I have two other roommates who I hadn't met beforehand, Alex and Brody (yes, two roommates named Alex). Both of them have been in Spain for one semester already, so they were a huge help for getting used to Spain. Our host family is very nice, and they make some pretty great food for dinner every night.</p>
        <h4>School</h4>
        <p>School is pretty standard so far, I'm taking:
        <br>- Political Systems of the Sub-Sahara
        <br>- Linear Algebra
        <br>- Circuits 2 + Lab
        <br>- Computer Architecture and Organization</p>
        <h4>The slightly more exciting stuff</h4>
        <p>After the first week of school, SLU Madrid hosted a trip out to Monasterio de Piedra, a monastery north of Madrid, that I went on. The trip was awesome, the monastery was beautiful and the park surrounding it was even more beautiful. The park was full of waterfalls and had some awesome hiking trails that we were able to explore for a couple of hours. I didn't have a phone to take any pictures, but my friends did, and one of those pictures is the background currently.</p>
        <p>Other than that, I've just been exploring the city when I'm not in class. We are currently planning some trips, maybe to Amsterdam or Switzerland somewhere.</p>
