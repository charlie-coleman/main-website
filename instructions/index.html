                The 27-card trick is a variation on the 21-card trick. The trick utilizes the Gergonne p-pile principle to place a card at any point in the deck. The Gergonne principle was developed by Joseph Diaz Gergonne when he was alive in the 18th or 19th century. The card trick has gone through many variations over the past couple hundred years, and in this set of instructions, we will just be talking about the 27 card version of the 21 card trick

                To begin, we must first learn a little math. We are basically just converting a base-10 number into base-3. It's a very simple conversion.<br><br> For a visual, click each step to change the image on the right.

                    6) After finishing dealing the cards, you have to refer to the base-3 number we are using to decide the order the cards are picked up in. The first deal looks at the first digit on the right. A 0 gets picked up last, 1 gets picked up second, and 2 gets picked up first. The other 2 piles can be picked up in any order. Our number is 021, the first digit is a 1 so we pick it up second.
